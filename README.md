# Spiro-OOP
animations/processing

my https://github.com/JuzerNejm10/Spiro rewritten in OOP style

changed some animation parametars so the output is not exactly the same

i also added the option to restart (refresh) the sketch by clicking the right mouse button - different animation will be generated

pressing "R" the second time now doesn't interfere with the video creation, it rather pauses recording

you can press it one more time to continue recording (if you refresh the sketch during the recording only the 1st animation will be saved)
